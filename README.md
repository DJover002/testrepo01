# Getting Started with GitHub and Creating Branches

GitHub overview
Before we learn to use GitHub, let's first review Git. Git is an open source version-control system for software development. It is simply a place where you can collect all your folders and files for a project. This collection of folders and files is usually called a repository.

GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command-line tool and you also need to host and maintain a server using the command line, GitHub provides the Git server for you, as well as a web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as wikis and basic task management tools, for every project.

GitHub provides cloud storage for source code, supports all popular programming languages, and streamlines the iteration process. GitHub includes a free plan for individual developers and for hosting open source projects.
